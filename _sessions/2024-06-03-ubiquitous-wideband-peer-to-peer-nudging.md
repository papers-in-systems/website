Mel Conway (of Conway's Law fame) has been researching and exploring in the area of new emergent phenomenon since the
recent combination of Internet, smartphones, and social networking apps; the working name he is giving that new 
phenomenon is "ubiquitous connectivity". His thesis is that it's changing the way we're organizing ourselves, we don't
understand it, and we'd better do something about that lack of understanding. This current work is a generalization and
formalization of the "Zipf's Law" [hypothesis that Mel has been exploring](https://melconway.com/Home/pdf/ZipfConsequences.pdf).
