Our Papers in Systems discussion series will continue with discussion of â€œSystems explained by Humberto Maturana," with a selection of 14 video clips (and/or transcripts thereof) of conversations in which Humberto Maturana discusses some of his key ideas about systems and related, with Prof. Ray Ison.

The video segments, and transcripts thereof, are full of gems, such as

> "I use the word system to refer to any collection of elements that, through preferential interactions between them, generate a boundary with respect to other elements with which they can also interact in such a way that a totality results from this boundary that arises through the preferential interaction between the elements that constitute the system."

Humberto Maturana made major contributions to how we understand systems, and this is a wonderful opportunity to discuss systems and Maturana's ideas.

The discussion will be led by [Hibri Marzook](https://www.hibri.net).

When: [March 4th, 2023, 2PM - 3PM Eastern Time (US/Canada)](https://ti.to/bredemeyer/maturanaonsystems). The Zoom room will remain open until 3:30PM for informal discussion (for the "hallway chat" part).

The video (transcript of each segment follows each video segment) is available at: [https://www.open.edu/openlearn/money-management/management/leadership-and-management/managing/systems-explained-humberto-maturana](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/money-management/management/leadership-and-management/managing/systems-explained-humberto-maturana)
