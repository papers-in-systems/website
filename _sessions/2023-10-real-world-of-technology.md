> I start from the premise that we are living in a very difficult, very interesting time, a time in which a major historical period is coming to a convoluted end. I think we live in a time in which the social and political upheaval is as great or greater than it was at the time of the Reformation. And so I would like to do a bit of orienteering and map-making so the discourse in which we all have to engage can be conducted in a common language. As I see it, technology has built the house in which we all live. The house is continually being extended and remodelled.

&mdash; Ursula M Franklin in The Real World of Technology
